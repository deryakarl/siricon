# Quantum Manifesto v1.0.3

**Sirius Quantum** — Established 2021

## Axioms

**Axiom 1: Scientific innovation belongs to humanity**
The quantum revolution, like all technological advances, must serve the collective good rather than concentrate power.

**Axiom 2: Right to build**
Every individual has the right to build, create, and participate in the quantum ecosystem. We reject gatekeeping and embrace open collaboration.

**Axiom 3: Open quantum networks**
Quantum networks must remain open, accessible, and resistant to centralization. The architecture we build today will shape the power structures of tomorrow.

**Axiom 4: Decentralized quantum AI**
Decentralized AI in the quantum space represents our best hope for systems that can solve global challenges while respecting human autonomy and diversity.

**Axiom 5: Human amplification**
We commit to developing technologies that amplify human potential rather than replace it, that connect rather than divide, and that liberate rather than control.

## Protocols

**Protocol 1: Open source quantum algorithms**
All fundamental quantum algorithms developed under this manifesto shall be released as open-source code, accessible to all of humanity.

**Protocol 2: Distributed quantum computing**
Quantum computing resources shall be designed for distributed access, preventing monopolization by any single entity.

**Protocol 3: Quantum ethics verification**
All quantum AI systems must include transparent ethical verification mechanisms that can be audited by independent third parties.

**Protocol 4: Knowledge preservation**
Quantum discoveries shall be documented and preserved in multiple formats to ensure longevity beyond any single technological paradigm.

**Protocol 5: Universal quantum literacy**
Education about quantum technologies shall be made accessible to all, regardless of economic or social status.

*Zilver is the first implementation of these protocols — an open, Apple Silicon-native quantum simulation network that anyone can join.*
